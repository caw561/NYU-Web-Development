        <h4>Early Life</h4>
        <p> &emsp;Alan Wagner was born in New Orleans to parents Billiam Wagner and Loretta Wagner. His father, 
            coal miner by trade, would perform with his jazz group, The Swinging Beboops, in the evenings at local jazz
            clubs. His parents were so heavly invested in hazz culture they did not notice their only child was more
            interested in the pragmatic beauty of numbers and accounting. </p>
        <p> &emsp;After being rejected from business school due to his colorblindness, Alan started his pursuit into
            entertainment. He began by writing errotic puppet shows, mostly performing for eldery communities. His 
            success in puppeteering lead him to meet his first manager, Larry 'Stache Man' Williams. Stache man 
            encouraged Alan to start incorporating more comedy into his pieces as he thought mainstream media would find
            his work too obscene. Alan then enrolled in the Comedy Univeristy of America where he majored
            in Comedian studies. </p>
