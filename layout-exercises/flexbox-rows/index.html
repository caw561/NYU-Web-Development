                <h5>Strawberry Fields Forever</h5>
                <p>Let me take you down
                    'Cause I'm going to strawberry fields
                    Nothing is real
                    And nothing to get hung about
                    Strawberry fields forever
                    Living is easy with eyes closed
                    Misunderstanding all you see
                    It's getting hard to be someone, but it all works out
                    It doesn't matter much to me
                    Let me take you down
                    'Cause I'm going to strawberry fields
                    Nothing is real
                    And nothing to get hung about
                    Strawberry fields forever
                    No one I think is in my tree
                    I mean, it must be high or low
                    That is, you can't, you know, tune in, but it's alright
                    That is, I think it's not too bad
                    Let me take you down
                    'Cause I'm going to strawberry fields
                    Nothing is real
                    And nothing to get hung about
                    Strawberry fields forever
                    Always, no sometimes, think it's me
                    But you know, I know when it's a dream
                    I think I know, I mean a yes
                    But it's all wrong
                    That is, I think I disagree
                    Let me take you down
                    'Cause I'm going to strawberry fields
                    Nothing is real
                    And nothing to get hung about
                    Strawberry fields forever
                    Strawberry fields forever

                <p>There must be lights burning brighter somewhere
                    Got to be birds flying higher in a sky more blue
                    If I can dream of a better land
                    Where all my brothers walk hand in hand
                    Tell me why, oh why, oh why can't my dream come true
                    Oh why
                    There must be peace and understanding sometime
                    Strong winds of promise that will blow away the doubt and fear
                    If I can dream of a warmer sun
                    Where hope keeps shining on everyone
                    Tell me why, oh why, oh why won't that sun appear
                    We're lost in a cloud
                    With too much rain
                    We're trapped in a world
                    That's troubled with pain
                    But as long as a man
                    Has the strength to dream
                    He can redeem his soul and fly
                    Deep in my heart there's a trembling question
                    Still I am sure that the answer, answer's gonna come somehow
                    Out there in the dark, there's a beckoning candle, yeah
                    And while I can think, while I can talk
                    While I can stand, while I can walk
                    While I can dream
                    Oh, please let my dream
                    Come true
                    Right now
                    Let it come true right now

                    Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me
                    In the jingle jangle morning I'll come following you
                    Though I know that evening's empire has returned into sand
                    Vanished from my hand
                    Left me blindly here to stand, but still not sleeping
                    My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet
                    I have no one to meet
                    And the ancient empty street's too dead for dreaming
                    Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me

                    In the jingle jangle morning I'll come following you
                    Take me on a trip upon your magic swirling ship
                    My senses have been stripped
                    My hands can't feel to grip
                    My toes too numb to step
                    Wait only for my boot heels to be wandering
                    I'm ready to go anywhere, I'm ready for to fade
                    Into my own parade
                    Cast your dancing spell my way, I promise to go under it...

                    It's only right that you should

                    But listen carefully
                    To the sound of your loneliness
                    Like a heartbeat drives you mad

                    And what you lost

                    Oh, thunder only happens when it's rainin'

                    Make it up as we go along
                    Feet on the ground, head in the sky

                    Out of all those kinds of people
                    You got a face with a view
                    I'm just an animal looking for a home, and
                    Share the same space for a minute or two
                    And you love me 'til my heart stops

                    I'm coming back love, cruel Heathcliff
                    My one dream, my only master
                    Too long I roam in the night
                    I'm coming back to his side to put it right
                    I'm coming home to wuthering, wuthering
                    Wuthering Heights
                    Heathcliff, it's me, I'm Cathy
                    I've come home, I'm so cold
                    Let me in your window
                    Heathcliff, it's me, I'm Cathy
                    I've come home, I'm so cold
                    Let me in your window
                    Ooh, let me have it
                    Let me grab your soul away...

                <p>It's a God-awful small affair
                    To the girl with the mousy hair
                    But her mummy is yelling, "No"
                    And her daddy has told her to go
                    But her friend is nowhere to be seen
                    Now she walks through her sunken dream
                    To the seat with the clearest view
                    And she's hooked to the silver screen
                    But the film is a saddening bore
                    For she's lived it ten times or more
                    She could spit in the eyes of fools
                    As they ask her to focus on
                    Sailors fighting in the dance hall
                    Oh man, look at those cavemen go
                    It's the freakiest show
                    Take a look at the lawman
                    Beating up the wrong guy
                    Oh man, wonder if he'll ever know
                    He's in the best selling show
                    Is there life on Mars?
                    It's on America's tortured brow
                    That Mickey Mouse has grown up a cow
                    Now the workers have struck for fame
                    'Cause Lennon's on sale again
                    See the mice in their million hordes
                    From Ibiza to the Norfolk Broads
                    Rule Britannia is out of bounds
                    To my mother, my dog, and clowns

                    'Cause I wrote it ten times or more

                    Through wars of worlds invaded by Mars
                    You made 'em laugh, you made 'em cry

                <p>Hello darkness, my old friend
                    I've come to talk with you again
                    Because a vision softly creeping
                    Left its seeds while I was sleeping
                    And the vision that was planted in my brain
                    Still remains
                    Within the sound of silence
                    In restless dreams I walked alone
                    Narrow streets of cobblestone
                    'Neath the halo of a street lamp
                    I turned my collar to the cold and damp
                    When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
                    That split the night
                    And touched the sound of silence
                    And in the naked light I saw
                    Ten thousand people, maybe more
                    People talking without speaking
                    People hearing without listening
                    People writing songs that voices never share
                    No one dared
                    Disturb the sound of silence
                    "Fools" said I, "You do not know
                    Silence like a cancer grows
                    Hear my words that I might teach you
                    Take my arms that I might reach you"
                    But my words like silent raindrops fell
                    And echoed in the wells of silence
                    And the people bowed and prayed
                    To the neon god they made
                    And the sign flashed out its warning
                    In the words that it was forming
                    And the sign said... </p>

                    I feel time is up
                    When I was a child, I never knew enough
                    What that do to me?
                    The wave of love is a transient hunt
                    Water's the shell and we are the nut

                    Look at all the peaches

                    Can't appear inside of nowhere

                    I rushed in to hold down your page
                    And now I sleep 'side words you do not read with me
                    I hear a song from inside the maze, the very one you made
                    You shook at the ivory mantle
                    As a poet, I knew to be gentle
                    When you have a child, so begins the braiding
                    And in that braid you stay
                    Look at all the peaches

                    I can appear inside of nowhere

                    It's already dead
                    I know you have the dove...

                <h5>Every Single Night</h5>
                <p>Every single night
                    I endure the flight
                    Of little wings of white-flamed
                    Butterflies in my brain
                    These ideas of mine
                    Percolate the mind
                    Trickle down the spine
                    Swarm the belly, swelling to a blaze
                    That's where the pain comes in
                    Like a second skeleton
                    Trying to fit beneath the skin
                    I can't fit the feelings in
                    Every single night's alight with my brain
                    What'd I say to her?
                    Why'd I say to her?
                    What does she think of me?
                    That I'm not what I ought to be
                    That I'm what I try not to be
                    It's got to be somebody else's fault
                    I can't get caught
                    If what I am is what I am, 'cause I does what I does
                    Then brother, get back, 'cause my breast's gonna bust open
                    The rib is the shell and the heart is the yolk
                    I just made a meal for us both to choke on
                    Every single night's a fight with my brain
                    I just want to feel everything
                    I just want to feel everything
                    I just want to feel everything
                    So I'm gonna try to be still now
                    Gonna renounce the mill a little while and
                    If we had a double-king-sized bed
                    We could move in it and I'd soon forget
                    That what I am is what I am 'cause I does what I does
                    And maybe I'd relax, let my breast just bust open...

                <p>It's fine, it's cool
                    You can say that we are nothing, but you know the truth
                    And guess I'm the fool
                    With her arms out like an angel through the car sunroof
                    I don't wanna call it off
                    But you don't wanna call it love
                    You only wanna be the one that I call "baby"
                    You can kiss a hundred boys in bars
                    Shoot another shot, try to stop the feeling
                    You can say it's just the way you are
                    Make a new excuse, another stupid reason
                    Good luck, babe (well, good luck), well, good luck, babe (well, good luck)
                    You'd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling
                    Good luck, babe (well, good luck), well, good luck, babe (well, good luck)
                    You'd have to stop the world just to stop the feeling
                    I'm cliché, who cares?
                    It's a sexually explicit kind of love affair
                    And I cry, it's not fair
                    I just need a little lovin', I just need a little air
                    Think I'm gonna call it off
                    Even if you call it love
                    I just wanna love someone who calls me "baby"
                    You can kiss a hundred boys in bars
                    Shoot another shot, try to stop the feeling

                <h5>Cosmic Love</h5>
                <p>A falling star fell from your heart and landed in my eyes
                    I screamed aloud as it tore through them
                    And now it's left me blind
                    The stars, the moon
                    They have all been blown out
                    You've left me in the dark
                    No dawn, no day
                    I'm always in this twilight
                    In the shadow of your heart
                    And in the dark
                    I can hear your heartbeat
                    I tried to find the sound
                    But then it stopped
                    And I was in the darkness
                    So darkness I became
                    The stars, the moon
                    They have all been blown out
                    You've left me in the dark
                    No dawn, no day
                    I'm always in this twilight
                    In the shadow of your heart
                    I took the stars from my eyes and then I made a map
                    And knew that somehow I could find my way back
                    Then I heard your heart beating, you were in the darkness too
                    So I stayed in the darkness with you
                    The stars, the moon
                    They have all been blown out
                    You've left me in the dark
                    No dawn, no day
                    I'm always in this twilight
                    In the shadow of your heart
                    The stars, the moon
                    They have all been blown out
                    You've left me in the dark (you left me in the dark)...
